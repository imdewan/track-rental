### 2. Install Dependencies

### 3. Configure Firebase Environment Variables

Track Rental uses Firebase for authentication, database, and storage. You need to set up a Firebase project and obtain your credentials.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

You can find these values in your Firebase project settings under **Project Overview > Project Settings > General**.

#### Example:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=track-rental.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=track-rental
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=track-rental.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456

## Firestore & Storage Security Rules

To keep your data secure and ensure users can only access their own documents and files, you can use the following Firestore and Storage rules. Add these in your Firebase console under **Firestore Rules** and **Storage Rules** respectively:

### Firestore Rules

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Match all collections and documents
    match /{collection}/{docId} {

      // Allow read if the user owns the document
      allow read: if request.auth != null
                  && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

      // Allow create only if the userId in the document matches the authenticated user
      allow create: if request.auth != null
                    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

      // Allow update and delete only if the existing document belongs to the user
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null
                            && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

These rules ensure that each user can only read, create, update, or delete documents where the `userId` field matches their own Firebase UID.

### Storage Rules

```js
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /images/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

These storage rules ensure that users can only read and write files in their own folder under `/images/{userId}/`, where `{userId}` matches their Firebase UID.
