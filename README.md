### 3. Configure Firebase Environment Variables

Track Rental uses Firebase for authentication, database, and storage. You need to set up a Firebase project and obtain your credentials.

VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

You can find these values in your Firebase project settings under **Project Overview > Project Settings > General**.

#### Example:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=track-rental.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=track-rental
